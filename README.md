# Flutter Expense Tracker

A Flutter project adapted from a udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller ([Link to Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/))

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
